We will load the Tooth Growth data set and provide a summary and exploration of the data set.  

We will then determine if given the size of the groups the differences between the means in each group atre statistically significant.


```{r}
library(datasets)
library(dplyr)
data(ToothGrowth)
tg <- ToothGrowth
class(tg)
summary(tg)
```

The following table lists the size of each subject group

```{r}
count(tg, dose, supp)
```

The following table lists the mean tooth length for each group

```{r}
ag <- aggregate(len ~ ., data = ToothGrowth, mean)
xtabs(len ~ ., data = ag)
```

The following table lists the standard deviation of the tooth length for each group

```{r}
ag <- aggregate(len ~ ., data = ToothGrowth, sd)
xtabs(len ~ ., data = ag)
```
